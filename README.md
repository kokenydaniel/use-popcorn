## About The Project

The app called "usePopcorn" is an intuitive and user-friendly platform that helps users find and rate their favorite movies and series. The app offers many features that make it easy to find content and manage your personal lists.

### Main functions:

- Search and Browse: The app allows users to easily search for movies and series by title. Search results contain detailed information including title, year of publication.

- Rating and Commenting: Users can rate the content they see.

- Personal Lists: Users can create their own list, such as "Already Seen". The list helps you organize and keep track of the content you watch.

- Average Rating: The application automatically calculates the average rating of movies and series rated by the user. This makes it easy to find out how enjoyable the selected content is overall.

- Summary in Lists: The application displays the total number of minutes of movies and series in user-created lists. This allows users to plan and easily track how much time they spend on their favorite content.

The "usePopcorn" application combines search, rating and personal list management to give users a complete experience in the world of movies and series.

## Built in

1. React
2. CSS
3. Javascript

## What I learned

Built with React and many valuable lessons can be learned:

API Integration: In the project, I used an API providing detailed information about movies and series. Through this, I learned how to query, manage and display data on the user interface.
State management: React's state management provides an opportunity to transfer and update data between components. I used this functionality to track ratings, lists, and averages.
User Experience (UX): During the project, I learned about the design of intuitive user interfaces and the principles of UX design. How users can easily browse, rate and follow content in the app.
Project Structure and Modular Code: During application development, I learned the project structure and the modular structure of the components, which contributes to easier maintainability and scalability.
Testing and Debugging: During development, I experienced the importance of testing and debugging. How to effectively test components and track and fix bugs.
All of these lessons help me to develop modern web applications more and more confidently and efficiently, and to better understand the use of React, Tailwind CSS and the Vite framework in project development.
